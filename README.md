# ANALYSIS-OF-TSV-s
● The objective of the project was to provide a probable solution to mitigate challenges that are being encountered due to metallic vias. ● We compared various materials like Copper, Tungsten, Aluminum, Carbon Nano Tubes (CNTs) as the probable substitute. ● The model was designed in SolidWorks and then imported to ANSYS Icepak. ● The model remained same through the process, while the material for TSV's were changed for each run. ● The Thermal analysis was done in ANSYS-Icepak and the results where compared. ● The results showed that Catbon Nano Tubes (CNTs) seemed to be better choice for next generation vertical interconnect access technology due to its properties and its suitability to micro- scale electronic applications.
